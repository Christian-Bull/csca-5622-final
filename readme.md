# CSCA-5622 Final Project

For the final project, you will identify a Supervised Learning problem to perform EDA and model analysis.  The project has 140 total points. In the instructions is a summary of the criteria you will use to guide your submission and review others’ submissions.   You will submit three deliverables:

## Deliverables
Deliverable 1 - A Jupyter notebook showing a supervised learning problem description, EDA procedure, analysis (model building and training), result, and discussion/conclusion. 

Deliverable 2 - A video presentation or demo of your work. 

Deliverable 3 - A public project GitHub repository with your work (please also include the GitHub repo URL in your notebook/report and slides). 

## Steps
Step 1 - Gather data, determine the method of data collection and provenance of the data (1 point)

Step 2 - Identify a Supervised Machine Learning Problem (5 points)

Step 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Inspect, Visualize and Clean the Data (34 points)

Step 4 - Perform Analysis Using Supervised Machine Learning Models of your Choice, Present Discussion and Conclusions (65 points)

Step 5 - Produce Deliverables: High-Quality, Organized Jupyter Notebook Report, Video presentation, and GitHub Repository (35 points)
